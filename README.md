--------------------> Introduction <--------------------

This game is a personal proyect developed in java for fun and learning. 

It's a two player's fighting game, 1 versus 1. Each one select one of the 5 unique characters and have to 
low the others health to 0. The characters are:
  - Planet: A big body with an epileptic satellite that deals a lot of DPS when it's over the enemy. It's very
    strong and have a lot of health, but slow. It's medium-hard difficulty to play.
  - Melee: A tiny body that can be raged so it increase a lot his speed, but he gets tired. His stats are
    average when its not raged. It's easy to play.
  - Ranged: An unstoppable shooting machine that can shoot over 4 directions. It's very squishy but fast
    and can be a pain to play against. Kite (attacking while moving) it's the key. It's hard to play.
  - Poison: A non-stop poison machine that left a trail wherever it goes. It can transform into a golden statue
    for a short periode of time, being invulnerable but cannot move. Timing it's the key. It's hard to play.
  - Shotgun: It's a slow character that shoot 9 bullets each time, but its slow relading. Each bullet has unique
    damage, so it can be letal at very short ranged. Do not miss your shoots! Its medium difficulty to play.

In addition, sometimes will spawn in the map bombs and health packages. Of course, if you touch the bomb, it will
deal damage to your character but if you get the health package, you will heal.


Tips:
  - The satellite of planet can stop the bullets both of the Ranged and the Shotgun. But it can't clean the poison.
  - If you are Ranged, you can cover behind the bombs.
