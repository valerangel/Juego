--------------------> Introduction <--------------------

This game is a personal project developed in Java for fun and learning. 

It's a two player fighting game in 2D, 1 versus 1. Each one selects one of the 5 unique characters and has to low the other's health to 0. The characters are:
  - Avo G.C.: A big body with an epileptic satellite that deals a lot of DPS when it's in contact with the enemy. It's very
    strong and has a lot of health, but slow. It's medium difficulty to play.
  - Dhiervas Q.: A tiny body that can be raged to increase a lot his speed, but it gets tired, as it has a stamina meter that has to refill.       Its stats are average when it's not raged. It's easy to play.
  - Pemetint: An unstoppable shooting machine that can shoot towards 4 directions. It's very squishy but fast
    and can be a pain to play against. Kiting (attacking while moving) is the key to success. It's hard to play.
  - Tonin T.T.: A non-stop poison machine that leaves a trail wherever it goes. It can transform into a golden statue
    for a short period of time, being invulnerable but not being able to move. Timing is key. It's hard to play.
  - CortinaPls A.: It's a slow character that shoots 9 bullets at once, but it's slow reloading. Each bullet has identical, separate
    damage, so it can be lethal at very short ranges. Do not miss your shots! It's medium difficulty to play.

In addition, some bombs and health packages will spawn randomly on the battle area. Of course, if you touch the bomb, it will
deal damage to your character but if you get the health package, you will heal.


Tips:
  - The satellite of Avo G.C. can stop the bullets both of the Pemetint and CortinaPls A. But it can't clean the poison.
